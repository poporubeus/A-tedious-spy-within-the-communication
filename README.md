# A tedious spy within the quantum communication
QKD algorithm written in Python aims to show the effect of a spy inside the quantum communcation between two parties. 

# Description
BB84 protocol is an algorithm invented for the first time by Charles Bertrand and Gilles Brassard who asked themselves if quantum cryptography could have been better than its already known classical counterpart. Theoretically the answer is "Yes" because, thanks to Quantum Mechanics and its principles, every time an eavesdropper had access to the "quantum message" transmitted by the parties, he would have been detected by his necessity of making a measurement on the target qubit.
In fact, accessing the content of the message could not be possibile without measuring the message itself, or making a measurement of the entity thet encodes it. This translate into breaking the symmetry of Quantum Mechanics: states are superpositions of many probability amplitudes and only a measurement can "select" a unique state out of them. 

### The algorithm
Suppose Alice and Bob would like to communicate by a quantum device. The idea 
use({
  "hrsh7th/nvim-cmp",
  requires = {
    { "kdheepak/cmp-latex-symbols" },
  },
  sources = {
    {
      name = "latex_symbols",
      option = {
        strategy = 0, -- mixed
      },
    },
  },
})
